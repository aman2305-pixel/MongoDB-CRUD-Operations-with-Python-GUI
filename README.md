# MongoDB-CRUD-Operations-with-Python-GUI

üìå Problem Statement
Managing data manually or using traditional file-based systems is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks scalability. There is a need for a simple desktop-based application that allows users to easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) records in a database with a user-friendly interface.

üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Python Tkinter GUI application that integrates with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations efficiently. This project demonstrates how databases and graphical interfaces can work together to provide a seamless experience for data management.

üíª Software & Hardware Requirements
Software:
Python 3.9 or above
MongoDB (Local or Atlas)
PyMongo library
Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
Operating System: Windows/Linux/Mac

Hardware:
Processor: Dual-core 2.0 GHz or above
RAM: 4 GB minimum
Storage: 200 MB free space

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
GUI Library: Tkinter
Connector: PyMongo

‚ú® Features
Insert new records into the MongoDB database
View all records in a text area (or table in extended version)
Update existing records (Name, Age, Course)
Delete records by Name
Clear input fields easily
Simple and user-friendly interface

üì∑ Output Explanation
Insert: Add a new student record by entering name, age, and course.
Read: Displays all records stored in MongoDB inside the GUI window.
Update: Modify an existing student‚Äôs name, age, or course using the search field.
Delete: Remove a record from the database using the student‚Äôs name.
GUI Layout:
            Entry fields for Name, Age, Course
            Buttons for Insert, Read, Update, Delete
            Text area/Table to show all database records

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how Python (Tkinter) and MongoDB can be integrated to build a lightweight desktop application for performing CRUD operations. It helps beginners understand:
How to connect Python applications with MongoDB
How to design a simple GUI using Tkinter
How CRUD operations work in real-world database-driven applications
Future enhancements can include:
Replacing text area with table view (Treeview)
Adding search and filter functionality
Migrating to MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage
Improving UI with modern frameworks like PyQt or Kivy
